With up to 250 horsepower on tap, the CX-30 2.5 Turbo is one of the quickest models in its class.",

With its exaggerated fender arches and raised roof rails, it easily looks the part of a get-back-to-nature SUV. There's some substance to the style, too, with an elevated stance good for 8.7 inches of ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive that can help this little Subaru find its way over rutted trails.",
